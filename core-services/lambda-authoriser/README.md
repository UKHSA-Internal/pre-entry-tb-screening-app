# Lambda-authoriser

Custom authentication and authorisation mechanism for all PETs API Gateway calls.

- Calls to PETs api gateway trigger Lambda handler [authorizer.ts][authorizer-ts], as described on [AWS Lambda Authorizer Input][lambda-authorizer-input].
- This Lambda will return a policy document, as described on [AWS Lambda Authorizer Input][lambda-authorizer-input].

## Documentation

See the [Lambda Authorizer Confluence page][confluence].

## Configuration

- Configuration is a TS object of type `AuthorizerConfig`.
- Both `AuthorizerConfig` and the configuration itself are in [configuration.ts][configuration-ts].
- A (fake) example can be found [here][fake-config].

## Prerequisites

### Node JS

Check you have Node and NPM in your terminal:

```shell script
node --version
npm --version
```

**We strongly recommend [`nvm`][nvm] to manage your Node installations** ([`nvm-windows`][nvm-windows] on Windows). The project's `.nvmrc` (root directory) contains the recommended Node version.

To install on Linux:

```shell script
sudo apt install nodejs
```

To install on MacOS, either:

- Download from [official site][nodejs]
- Use [Homebrew][homebrew]: `brew install node`

To install on Windows, either:

- Download from [official site][nodejs]
- Use [Chocolatey][chocolatey]: `cinst nodejs.install`

## Dependencies

```shell script
npm install
```

## Build

```shell script
npm run build
```

Output folder: `build/` (Git-ignored)

On Windows, you will need to use [Git Bash][git-bash]. You may also need to:

- replace `export` statements with your own environment variable configuration.
- find binaries for things like `cpio`.

## Test

```shell script
npm test
```

## Local Invocation

The [serverless-offline][serverless-offline] package is used to run the lambda locally. A test function is initialiased and protected by the lambda authoriser. Details of the configuration are in the serverless.yml file.
Before running/debugging, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`.

- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` needs to be a list of audiences the tokens will be validated against.
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID` needs to be the tenantId to use for the token validation.

### Running

Run `npm start` to run the test function and lambda authoriser. Once running, the test function can be called using postman or something similar. An example postman collection can be found at `tests/resources/authoriser.postman_collection.json`. There are a number of variables that need population before it will work. These are the details of credentials you will want to test i.e. clientId, secret etc.
If there is any reason the token does not allow access to the resource the reason is sent back in the response.

```json
{
  "statusCode": 403,
  "error": "Forbidden",
  "message": "User is not authorized to access this resource"
}
```

If the token does allow access, the request will be allowed through to the test function and `"Test function successfully invoked. Access was granted."` is returned in the response.

### Debugging

A debug configuration has been added that runs `npm start` under a debug session. Testing is performed via postman as described above.
